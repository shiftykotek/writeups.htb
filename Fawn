Connected to VPN.

Ran the following command: 
ftp -a 10.129.38.80

This successfully allowed me to log in to the ftp server on this IP address as an anonymous user.
By running ls, I was able to see that flag.txt was located on the server.
I used get flag.txt to download the text file to my VM, and typed exit to exit.

By typing cat flag.txt, I was able to see that the flag was 035db21c881520061c53e0536e44f815.
